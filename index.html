<!---- introduction ------->
This page is currently under construction 
Hello my name is Trevor Decker.  I am a roboticisit, engineer, tinkerer, scientist, and board game enthusist. 

Currently I am a part of Apple's Special Project Group before that I was a student at CMU where I studied ways for robots to understand and complete tasks under uncertinty.


Some of the places that I have traveled
Some projects that I have worked on
Some Code Examples
